            I am studying Computer Science at George Fox University with a concentration in cybersecurity.
            Throughout my childhood I had a very high interest in problem solving and discovering the inner 
            workings of hardware and software. This interest sparked my passion for software and web development.
            Currently, the languages I prefer to work with include Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and C++, but
            I am also very open to working with other languages. Some of my favorite personal projects include web 
            scraping for for a web automator and working with Spotify's funky API to create a Discord bot that plays 
            music for the user in a voice call. I also love to play basketball, lift weights, play video games, and 
            get outside as often as possible.
